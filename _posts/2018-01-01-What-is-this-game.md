Content creation is hard enough without adding bad HTML into the mix. Echoing his recent talk at [MozCon](https://moz.com/mozcon), we're excited to welcome Ian Lurie from [Portent, Inc](https://www.portent.com/). on this episode of Whiteboard Friday. Learn how to cut out the cruddy code produced from writing in word processors by adopting Markup and text editors as your go-to writing solution.

## 1. The tragedy of content creation

So first thing you've got to understand: The one great tragedy of content creation is HTML. If you're a writer or producer or someone like that and you're creating content, you always run into the problem of trying to get that blog post live or trying to get that page live or whatever else, and you end up with one of four possibilities.

- You get bad HTML, because you're trying to write it yourself and you don't know how. I'm one of those people, at least I was until recently.
- You have no HTML at all because you can't do it, and there's no one else to do it, so you end up pasting plain text directly into your word processor.
- You get really slow HTML, because it takes you a long time to punch in all of those tags, or you can find a producer, but it's going to take a long time to find that producer.
- You get really bad HTML, because you write in a word processor, like Word or OpenText or something like that, and you save as HTML, which delivers something that would make any decent HTML programmer pretty much weep tears of blood because it looks so horrible. It adds all this extra stuff. It doesn't render correctly in most browsers, so you don't want to do that either.

So the problem is: How do you create HTML as a writer, without having it interfere with your writing process, right? You don't want to be typing stuff in and all of a sudden you have to stop to write in tags. Without slowing things down because you don't want to have to go back and edit all the HTML either. How do you do that?

## 2. Yay, markdown!

Well, yay for us, there's this thing called Markdown, and Markdown was created by a developer who runs a blog called Daring Fireball, and I will link to the [Markdown Syntax Guide](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) on that site so you can very easily look at it and see it. It is designed to be a really simple way to write in plain text and, with a few simple characters, tag it so that it will turn into really clean, really good HTML.

### The great things about Markdown:

- You do write in plain text, so any text editor. You can use one on your phone. You can use one on your laptop. It can be TextEdit, Notepad, anything. I'm going to name a specific text editor in a minute that I think is the best one for you to use. But it could be anything, and you can edit it in anything. It's fully portable.
    - That means it's really **fast**, right? Text editors don't bog down with updates, generally. They don't run into those kinds of problems, so they run really, really fast.
    - Text is **future-proof**. When the day comes that we're no longer reading stuff in text and opening text files, we'll all be communicating directly head-to-head, and we won't worry about all this stuff anyway because you won't need HTML. I'm getting a little bit ahead of myself, but it is future-proof, because 50 years from now you will still be able to open a plain text file.
    - It's *relatively* **crash-free**. I've always said I've never had a text editor crash. It's true. I've never had one, but as soon as I say that, everybody starts raising their hands and saying, "I had my text editor crash." Maybe it's because you're on Windows. I don't know. I shouldn't say that. But it's relatively crash-free, all right? So it's much more stable than using a word processor.
    
## 3. Syntax

Syntax is really simple. Again, I'm going to [link to the syntax](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax). I'm not going to give you the complete course on the syntax. The truth is this is 50% of what you'll probably need right here.

But just as an example, if you want to do a level one heading, you do a single pound sign or a hash, a space, and then whatever your text is. When you convert it to HTML, it will automatically become H1, heading one, closing H1. Same thing with H2. You just do two hashes. You can imagine what you do for H3. It's three hashes.

**Paragraphs** are created automatically. So if you write some text and you hit Enter or return twice, you'll get a clean paragraph. If you want, by the way, for this to be a hard break instead, then you just do two spaces and then return, and it'll put a BR there instead of a paragraph.

![example](/images/3-68439.jpg)

**Lists** become lists, and this is one of the toughest things for writers. It was always the thing that slows me down the most is lists are pretty complicated in HTML. Well, here, you just go one, two, three, just normally your text, and when you save it and convert it, it's going to become order list, list item, list item, list item, closing order list. It's that easy. If you want to do a bulleted list, you just use asterisks instead. It'll do the same thing.

**Links**, I got really excited so I had to add this up here. Links are also really simple and in fact, again, super simplified in Markdown. What you've got here is you put your text in brackets, then in parentheses you put your web address. It will convert to a full link with the text as your proper link text. You can do the same thing with images. All you do is add an exclamation mark at the start.

So Markdown really lets you take your skills as a writer, focus on those skills, write really well, and convert it to equally good HTML. Then you've got HTML that's ready to be pasted into WordPress or whatever other system you want, or just to be used as a separate page.

That's it. I hope you have fun working with Markdown, and please leave any questions you have in the comments and I will get to them and answer them as quickly as I can. Thanks.
